      <h3>Reproducing Fitt's Law</h3>
      <p>As I build experimental apparatus for testing UI paradigms, I want to ensure it is producing results that are consistent with existing literature. For that reason, I'll be attempting to reproduce several basic, decades-old results. The first of these is Fitt's Law in 1 dimension.</p>

      <h3>What is Fitt's Law?</h3>
      <p>Fitt's law attempts to explain the relative amount of time it takes to point at an object (in this case with the mouse). It explains the way pointing time varies based on the distance to the object and the relative size of the object.</p>

      <h3>If I participate, how long will it take?</h3>
      <p>This is a short and simple task. It will take you approximately 5 minutes to complete; but be warned, it will be a pretty dull 5 minutes.</p>
