      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>I build experiments in an attempt to learn about
      human-computer interaction, and uncover more of those laws. I
      make the experiments available for anyone to participate in, my
      conclusions available for anyone to read and critique, and I
      make the raw data available for anyone to crunch.</p>

      <p>These experiments also serve as a storehouse of different interfaces that I've seen, admired, or asked questions about.</p>

      <h3>What do you mean by &ldquo;experiments?&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>We have basic laws of mouse-based actions (like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law">Fitts&rsquo;
          Law</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_law">Accot-Zhai
          Steering Law</a>), and laws of choice (like
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law">Hick-Hymen
          Law</a>). These laws tell us things that usually seem obvious
        in retrospect, but they attach that common sense to real
        measurements, and give us good back-of-the-envelope guesses
        about what variables are most important.</p>

    <div class="text section">
      <p>These laws hardly seem to cover the broad spectrum of
      interfaces afforded by combinations of mouse, keyboard,
      touchscreen and stylus. I get ideas for all kinds of strange
      human-computer interfaces; and (to judge from the movies) I'm
      not the only one. There's already a preponderance
      of <em>existing</em> interface elements. How do we choose? What
      makes one better than another? What variables will alter
      efficiency and accuracy? These are the questions I want to
      answer.</p>

      <h3>This doesn't seem like a good way to measure intuitive, elegant UI.</h3>
      <p>You're right &mdash; it's not.</p>

      <p>Because it is in fashion at the moment to aim for a massive
      audience, of millions or even hundreds of millions of users,
      much emphasis has been placed on discoverability and intuitive
      design. That is good! There is a lot of software that everyone
      should be able to use without a learning curve.</p>

      <p>For the most part, intuitive just means
      &ldquo;familiar.&rdquo; If you want to build an intuitive UI,
      use whatever idioms your audience already uses most
      frequently.</p>

      <p>But I don't work at a startup; I work at a consultancy. We
      rarely get asked to build a new Facebook or another Twitter.
      We're more frequently tasked with building software that a small
      number of people use <em>all day, every day</em>. These are
      people who have little interest in intuitive design; they want
      speed and power. They're power users; or they want to be; or
      their employers want them to be.</p>

      <p>Data never tells the whole story; and efficency is never the
      only goal. But they're certainly <em>part</em> of the story,
      and <em>part</em> of the goal.</p>

      <h3>Why? Don't we already know a lot of this?</h3>
      <p>Perhaps less than you might think; and, if I rediscover
      something everyone else already knows, <em>I've</em> still
      learned something.</p>

      <p>I'm an Emacs user. When I first tried Sublime Text, it's file
      navigation was a complete revelation. If you're unfamiliar with
      it, you should give it a try. In particular, you can search for
      files based on 'initialisms': with the keystrokes <tt>Ctrl-p d a
      f</tt>, I could find the
      file <tt>'app/<strong>d</strong>irectives/<strong>a</strong>uto-<strong>f</strong>ocus'</tt>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      little gif of find anything
    </div>
    <div class="text section">
      <p>Where before I had to type most of the filename, now I was
      using four keystrokes! Four keystrokes is short enough to become
      muscle memory; I could open a file <em>just by thinking about
      it</em>.</p>

      <p>I returned to emacs-land, and did my best to recreate it;
      Atom has also tried to copy-cat. But everyone seems to copy
      the <em>appearance</em> of the interface without copying
      the <em>important</em> part: the scoring algorithm that puts the
      right file on top of the list. It's <strong>not</strong> just
      search, or even fuzzy search. It is its own distinct animal that
      deserves separate attention and respect.</p>


      <h3>Is any of this any use to normal people?</h3>
      <p>I designed an interface for a group of clothing specialists,
      once. They needed to enter specific, structured data about
      individual pieces of clothing, and the faster they did, the
      stronger their business would be.</p>

      <p>When I told them they should be using hotkeys, they were
      terrified. They were <em>not</em> technophilic; they were
      clothing-people, not computer-people, and they fully expected to
      be lost trying to use the new software.</p>

      <p>But when the new software was finished, I explained it to
      each of them, and made sure that mnemonics were clearly
      displayed. And within one workday &mdsash; faster than I
      had <em>dreamed</em> &mdash; 90% of their interactions were
      keyboard-only. And they <em>loved</em> it.</p>

      <p>Many, many jobs now involve using just one or two pieces of
      specialized software all day. Factory workers, sales associates,
      warehouse workers, middle managers, delivery truck drivers
      &mdash; really and truly, almost every job involves one piece of
      software so constant that it becomes almost invisible. It is
      those interfaces that deserve to be stunningly efficient and
      fantastically in-tune with their users.</p>
